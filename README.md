## 📋 Guide Overview

This multi-part guide covers building a modern React application using current industry standards and best practices. We'll build a **Task Management Application** that demonstrates real-world patterns used in enterprise applications.

### 🛠️ Technology Stack (Industry Standards 2025)

| Category | Technology | Why This Choice |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Build Tool** | Vite | ⚡ Faster than Create React App (deprecated Feb 2025), better DX |
| **UI Framework** | Material-UI (MUI) | 🎨 Google's Material Design, comprehensive component library |
| **Language** | TypeScript | 🔒 Type safety, better IDE support, industry standard |
| **State Management** | Redux Toolkit | 🏪 Still the industry standard for complex state management |
| **Forms** | React Hook Form + Zod | 📝 Better performance than Formik, modern validation |
| **Testing** | Vitest + React Testing Library | 🧪 Faster than Jest, Vite-native, great DX |
| **Routing** | React Router v6 | 🛣️ De facto standard for React SPAs |
| **HTTP Client** | Axios | 🌐 Interceptors, request/response transformation |
| **Deployment** | Vercel | 🚀 Free tier, automatic CI/CD, excellent performance |
